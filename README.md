## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For specific CSS needs

### What I learned

I improved my skills in Tailwind CSS and Next.js with TypeScript. I will continue learning about Next.js with TypeScript. I'm interested in deepening my knowledge and exploring more advanced features of this combination.
